# TCsys_public
the public ver of tcsys.

For help, it's compiled by VS and I left the .sln in the realise.
It should be fine if compiled by other ODE but better to use at least c++ 14.

To acquire the list of useful functions, read help in tcsys.h
There are some function not working and some weird logic (like you have to select person before create a new event), that would be fine someday. maybe.

Well, that's it.
